# Senior Capstone Autonomous Aerospace Vehicle Design - AERSP 497

Project by Jackson Fezell, Nicholas Giampetro, Ankit Gupta, Sebastian Nahme, and Davis Wetzel

Originally completed for AERSP 497 on 4/27/2024, this repository serves to archive this project for myself and my colleagues who worked on it.

This repository contains the Arduino flight code that was run on our vehicle G.E.O.F.F. It has a main.ino file and all the supporting C++ files and headers for the classes required to run the flight code. Documentation relating to the progress of our work throughout the year is also included in this repo.
